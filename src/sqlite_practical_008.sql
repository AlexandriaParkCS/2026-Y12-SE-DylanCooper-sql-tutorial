-- Practical 8: Advanced Queries with Subqueries
-- Student Name: Dylan Cooper

-- This script demonstrates subqueries and advanced query techniques

-- Query 1: Find all characters from the same planet as Luke Skywalker
-- First, let's see what planet Luke is from
SELECT homeworld_id FROM characters WHERE name = 'Luke Skywalker';
-- Now use that in a subquery
SELECT name, species
FROM characters
WHERE homeworld_id = (SELECT homeworld_id FROM characters WHERE name = 'Luke
Skywalker');
-- Query 2: Find characters taller than the average height
SELECT name, height
FROM characters
WHERE height > (SELECT AVG(height) FROM characters)
ORDER BY height DESC;
-- Query 3: Find characters from planets with "desert" terrain
SELECT name, species
FROM characters
WHERE homeworld_id IN (
SELECT id
FROM planets
WHERE terrain LIKE '%desert%'
);
-- Query 4: Find characters NOT from Tatooine or Alderaan
SELECT name, species
FROM characters
WHERE homeworld_id NOT IN (
SELECT id
FROM planets
WHERE name IN ('Tatooine', 'Alderaan')
);
-- Query 5: Find characters from planets with above-average population
SELECT c.name, p.name AS homeworld, p.population
FROM characters c
JOIN planets p ON c.homeworld_id = p.id
WHERE p.population > (
SELECT AVG(population)
FROM planets
WHERE population IS NOT NULL
)
ORDER BY p.population DESC;
-- Query 6: Find characters who pilot at least one vehicle
SELECT name, species
FROM characters c
WHERE EXISTS (
SELECT 1
FROM character_vehicles cv
WHERE cv.character_id = c.id
);
-- Query 7: Find characters who DON'T pilot any vehicles
SELECT name, species
FROM characters c
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
SELECT 1
FROM character_vehicles cv
WHERE cv.character_id = c.id
);
-- Query 8: Find planets that have at least one human character
SELECT p.name AS planet_name, p.climate
FROM planets p
WHERE EXISTS (
SELECT 1
FROM characters c
WHERE c.homeworld_id = p.id
AND c.species = 'Human'
);
-- Query 9: Find characters who pilot the same type of vehicle as Luke
SELECT DISTINCT c.name
FROM characters c
WHERE EXISTS (
SELECT 1
FROM character_vehicles cv1
JOIN vehicles v1 ON cv1.vehicle_id = v1.id
WHERE cv1.character_id = c.id
AND v1.vehicle_class IN (
SELECT v2.vehicle_class
FROM character_vehicles cv2
JOIN vehicles v2 ON cv2.vehicle_id = v2.id
JOIN characters c2 ON cv2.character_id = c2.id
WHERE c2.name = 'Luke Skywalker'
)
)
AND c.name != 'Luke Skywalker';
-- Query 10: Show each character with a count of how many vehicles they pilot
SELECT
c.name,
c.species,
(SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM character_vehicles cv
WHERE cv.character_id = c.id) AS vehicle_count
FROM characters c
ORDER BY vehicle_count DESC;
-- Query 11: Character statistics
SELECT
name,
height,
(SELECT AVG(height) FROM characters) AS avg_height,
height - (SELECT AVG(height) FROM characters) AS height_difference
FROM characters
WHERE height IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY height_difference DESC;

-- Exercise 1: Find all characters from planets with "temperate" climate
SELECT name, species
FROM characters
WHERE homeworld_id IN (
SELECT id
FROM planets
WHERE climate = 'temperate'
);
-- Exercise 2: Find vehicles piloted by more characters than average
SELECT v.name, COUNT(cv.character_id) AS pilot_count
FROM vehicles v
JOIN character_vehicles cv ON v.id = cv.vehicle_id
GROUP BY v.name
HAVING COUNT(cv.character_id) > (
SELECT AVG(pilot_cnt)
FROM (
SELECT COUNT(character_id) AS pilot_cnt
FROM character_vehicles
GROUP BY vehicle_id
)
);
-- Exercise 3: Find planets with no characters
SELECT name, climate
FROM planets p
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
SELECT 1
FROM characters c
WHERE c.homeworld_id = p.id
);
