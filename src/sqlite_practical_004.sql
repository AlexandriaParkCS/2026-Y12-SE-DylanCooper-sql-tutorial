-- This script demonstrates aggregate functions and grouping data
-- Query 1: Count how many characters are in the table
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM characters;
-- Query 2: Count characters who have a height recorded
SELECT COUNT(height) FROM characters;
-- Query 3: Find the tallest character's height
SELECT MAX(height) FROM characters;
-- Query 4: Find the shortest character's height
SELECT MIN(height) FROM characters;
-- Query 5: Calculate the average height of all characters
SELECT AVG(height) FROM characters;
-- Query 6: Add up all character heights
SELECT SUM(height) FROM characters;
-- Query 7: Get multiple statistics at once
SELECT
COUNT(*) AS total_characters,
AVG(height) AS average_height,
MAX(height) AS tallest,
MIN(height) AS shortest
FROM characters;
-- Query 8: Count how many characters of each species
SELECT species, COUNT(*) AS character_count
FROM characters
GROUP BY species;
-- Query 9: Find the average height for each species
SELECT species, AVG(height) AS average_height
FROM characters
WHERE height IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY species;
-- Query 10: Count characters from each homeworld
SELECT homeworld, COUNT(*) AS character_count
FROM characters
GROUP BY homeworld
ORDER BY character_count DESC;
-- Add affiliation column
ALTER TABLE characters ADD COLUMN affiliation TEXT;
-- Update characters with affiliations
UPDATE characters SET affiliation = 'Rebel Alliance' WHERE name IN ('Luke
Skywalker', 'Leia Organa', 'Han Solo', 'Chewbacca');
UPDATE characters SET affiliation = 'Jedi Order' WHERE name IN ('Obi-Wan Kenobi', 'Yoda');
UPDATE characters SET affiliation = 'Galactic Empire' WHERE name = 'Darth
Vader';
UPDATE characters SET affiliation = 'Independent' WHERE name = 'R2-D2';
-- Query 11: Count characters in each affiliation
SELECT affiliation, COUNT(*) AS members
FROM characters
WHERE affiliation IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY affiliation
ORDER BY members DESC;
-- Query 12: Show only species with 2 or more characters
SELECT species, COUNT(*) AS character_count
FROM characters
GROUP BY species
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2;
-- Query 13: Find affiliations with more than the average number of members
SELECT affiliation, COUNT(*) AS member_count
FROM characters
WHERE affiliation IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY affiliation
HAVING COUNT(*) > (SELECT AVG(cnt) FROM (SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM
characters WHERE affiliation IS NOT NULL GROUP BY affiliation));
-- Query 14: Count humans by homeworld, only showing planets with 2+ humans
SELECT homeworld, COUNT(*) AS human_count
FROM characters
WHERE species = 'Human'
GROUP BY homeworld
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2;
-- Query 15: How many different species are there?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT species) AS unique_species
FROM characters;
-- Query 16: How many different homeworlds are represented?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT homeworld) AS unique_homeworlds FROM characters;
-- Exercise 1: Find the total height of all characters combined
SELECT SUM(height) AS total_height
FROM characters;
-- Exercise 2: Count characters from each homeworld, sorted alphabetically
SELECT homeworld, COUNT(*) AS character_count
FROM characters
GROUP BY homeworld
ORDER BY homeworld;
-- Exercise 3: Find average height by affiliation
SELECT affiliation, AVG(height) AS avg_height
FROM characters
WHERE height IS NOT NULL AND affiliation IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY affiliation;
-- Exercise 4: Show homeworlds that have exactly 1 character
SELECT homeworld, COUNT(*) AS character_count
FROM characters
GROUP BY homeworld
HAVING COUNT(*) = 1;
